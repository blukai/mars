@BlindDerive
----
when you derive a trait (e.g., `Clone`) on a generic type, the derive just
assumes that all the generic parameters must be `Clone`. ofthen that is a valid
idea, but sometimes not.

@TryCloneIn
----
there's no checked (/ not oomable) standard cloning mechanism. see:

TODO:
  - simple file watcher. i don't like notify crate. i don't like its dependency
    on walkdir. i'm not sure i like that it handles crate creation internally
    without giving any control over it.
    maybe see https://github.com/focus-editor/focus/blob/fefbb480e593c3aef442d4f4851ef1175a349626/modules/File_Watcher/module.jai
  - improve rangealloc
  - genvec must use vec instead of std::vec::Vec
  - arena alloc
  - combine nohash and fxhash into a single hash crate
  - move genvec into collections
  - introduce arrayvec
